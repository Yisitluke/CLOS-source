## 1, What is CLOS?

Command Line Operand System, or CLOS, is a CLI-based operating system emulator. This program includes:

+ Boot menu
+ User creation and saved data
+ User hashed passwords
+ Four commands

..thats it. This entire project is HIGHLY a work-in-progress, so there are very few things to do.

## 2, Menus

There are several menus, this section will tell you how to create a user and use the Winix shell.

First, how do you even run the system? Just open a terminal where you placed the `CLOS.py` file and run:

```bash
python3 CLOS.py
