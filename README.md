An official manual for CLOS is planned in its next stage, so this README will only tell about how versioning works so you know what to expect.

CLOS uses two types of versioning:

+ **Version**: These are official releases, denoted as 'v`X.Y.Z`.'
+ **Builds**: These are testing stages, like a "dev" phase. This is denoted as 'b`X.Y.Z`.' These are going to be a thousand times more common, as versions are far away from now.

Both follow the X.Y.Z formatting, where:

+ **X** is the major version.
+ **Y** is the minor version.
+ **Z** is the patch-fix/very minor version.

Be note that versions wont be present for a while, so builds will be expected.

The current version as of now is `b0.0.1`.

Everything in the product is created by me (Yisitluke).

Have fun!
